# OktoberfestR
### A web application to analyze Oktoberfest data

This shiny app was inspired by a [blog post](https://gresch.github.io/2017/09/14/201701oktoberfest1985-2016/) made by @[gresch](https://gresch.github.io/) about analyzing [Oktoberfest](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oktoberfest) data and re-uses some of Gresch's code for the plots.
